## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **MetaMask** - [Install MetaMask Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/)
3. **Pinata Account** - [Sign up for Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cloudsafe
```

2. Install dependencies:
   
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
   
Create a `.env` file in the client directory:

```env
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
REACT_APP_PINATA_API_SECRET=your_pinata_secret_key
```

5. Start the local blockchain:
```bash
# In the root directory
npx hardhat node
```

5. Deploy the smart contract:
```bash
# In a new terminal
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

6. Start the application:

```bash
# In the client directory
npm start
```

## üí° Usage Guide

### Connecting Your Wallet
1. Install MetaMask if you haven't already
2. Connect MetaMask to the local network:
   - Network Name: Hardhat Local
   - RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
   - Chain ID: 31337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH

### Uploading Images
1. Click the "Choose Image" button
2. Select an image file from your device
3. Confirm the upload in MetaMask
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
5. Your image will be stored on IPFS and linked to your address

### Viewing Images
1. Your uploaded images appear automatically
2. Click "Get Data" to refresh the image list
3. Images are displayed in a responsive grid
4. Click any image to view it in full size

### Sharing Access
1. Click the "Share Access" button
2. Enter the Ethereum address of the recipient
3. Click "Share" and confirm the transaction
4. The recipient can now view your images
5. View current access permissions in the dropdown

### Managing Access
1. View all addresses with access in the sharing modal
2. Revoke access by using the smart contract directly
3. Track all access changes on the blockchain
